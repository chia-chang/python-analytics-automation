# COVID-19 Analytics Portfolio

> **Note**: This portfolio demonstrates my work as a Data Analyst on the COVID Analytics project at IBM, showcasing real-world data integration, automation, and visualization skills using publicly available data.

This portfolio recreates that work using public data to demonstrate:
- **80% reduction** in manual reporting time through automation
- Integration of 5+ disparate data sources
- Custom scripts enabling non-technical stakeholders to run analytics independently
- Automated dashboards and reports

## Business Impact (Original Project at IBM)

| Metric | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Daily Report Generation | 2-3 hours manual work | 10-15 minutes automated | **80% time saved** |
| Data Sources | 5 separate, messy files | 1 integrated dataset | Unified view |
| Update Frequency | Weekly | Daily | Real-time insights |

## Skills Demonstrated
